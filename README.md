# Koker

Building a Docker-like tool - `koker` - Kien's mini docker.

> What I cannot create, I do not understand â€” Richard Feynman

## 1. Introduction

- What is **Koker**?
  - Koker is a tiny educational-purpose Docker-like tool, written in Golang.
  - Unlike Docker, Koker just uses a set of Linux's operating system primitives that provide the illusion of a container. Tt uses neither [containerd](https://containerd.io/) nor [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc).
- Why **Koker**?
  - Have you ever wondered how Docker containers are constructed?
  - Koker provides an understanding of how extactly containers work at the Linux system call level by using logging (every steps!).
    - Control Groups for resource restriction (CPU, Memory, Swap, PIDs).
    - Namespace for global system resources isolation (Mount, UTS, Network, IPS, PID).
    - Union File System for branches to be overlaid in a single coherent file system. (OverlayFS)
- Should I use **Koker** in production?
  - Nope, Koker isn't a production ready tool.
- **Koker** is highly inspired by:
  - [Bocker](https://github.com/p8952/bocker).
  - [Containers-the-hard-way](https://github.com/shuveb/containers-the-hard-way)
  - [Vessel](https://github.com/0xc0d/vessel)
